Notification

This module provide a notification daemon for E.
It implements the galago specification :
http://www.galago-project.org/specs/notification/0.9/index.html

You can be notified in two ways, by popups or by icons. Popups are the usual way
of notifying, you can configure where they should appear and some other options
in E's configuration panel -> extensions -> notification. Notification box is a
gadget with the same style as ibox and go into a shelf. If an event occur the
image associated with the event (or this modules's logo if none) will appear
inside the box. A click on it will try to focus the source application of the
event, by matching the "application name" field with any windows class/name.
Configure a notification box is done by right clicking on it and selecting
"configuration".

By configuring which level of urgency popups and box should show, you can avoid
having both showing up everytime.

The icon displayed in the box may be ugly and aliased. It's due to the fact that
some apps use really small icons. An easy way to fix this is to make sure that
the application doesn't send a pixbuf but a path to the icon instead. And if this
icon is too small, replace it by a bigger one.

If you want to fire up a notification and make the module focus an application,
the easiest way is to use e-notify-send (in e_dbus if built with enotify) like
in this example:
e-notify-send -n classname_of_your_app -i "file:///path/to/an/icon" "foo" "bar"

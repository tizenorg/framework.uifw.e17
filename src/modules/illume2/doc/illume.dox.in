@section intro Introduction

Illume is a module for Enlightenment that modifies the user interface of 
enlightenment to work cleanly and nicely on a mobile device - such as an 
Openmoko phone. It is resolution independent meaning that it can 
accommodate a very wide range of devices, from cell phones and PDAs to 
tablets and desktops. Illume has been designed from the ground up to 
support multiple screens in more than one way using either xinerama or multi-head.

@warning This is a work in progress and as such is subject to change.
